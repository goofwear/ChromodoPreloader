<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a little program for people who use  Chromodo on older machines. It is designed to pre-load Chromodo in the background so it will load faster when requested.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Chromodo 1.0 or better</li>
	<li>4MB plus Enough memory to run Chromodo</li>
	<li>Window 95 or NT 4.0 or better</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Once you have downloaded the installation program, simply run this program and it will guide you through installing the Chromodo Preloader.  If you are running an older version, it is recommended that you unload it or you will have you restart your computer when the installation finishes.</p>
<p>The first time the pre-loader runs, it may ask you for the directory that Chromodo is installed in if it was unable to automatically find Chromodo.  You may change this later if you wish.</p>
<h2>Using the Preloader</h2>
<p>To use the Chromodo Preloader, simply place a shortcut in the Windows StartUp folder, if one is not present.  To begin using if right away, simply use the shortcut in the Windows Start Menu under the Chromodo Preloader program group.</p>
<p>When the Preloader is loaded, a Chromodo icon will appear in the system tray.  By right-clicking on the icon, you can bring up a menu of actions to control Chromodo and the Preloader.  By double-clicking on the icon, you can open a new Chromodo window with your currently set home page(s).</p>
<p>The Chromodo Preloader will immediately load a portion of  Chromodo into memory to cut the startup time of Chromodo in half.  As you begin to use Chromodo the remaining portions will be loaded into memory.  When all of the Chromodo Windows are closed, Chromodo will remain in memory and the next startup will be instantaneous.</p>
<p>If you use the &lsquo;File-&gt;Exit&rsquo; menu item in any Chromodo browser windows, Chromodo will be unloaded and all the memory it was using freed.  The Preloader will then reload Chromodo, making it available for later use.</p>
<h2>Installing and Removing Themes and Extensions</h2>
<p>Since the Chromodo Preloader will keep Chromodo loaded, even when no Chromodo windows are visible, installing or removing themes and extensions may not take affect as expected.  Since Chromodo must be restarted to remove or install a theme or extension, you must terminate Chromodo using either of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use the &lsquo;File-&gt;Exit&rsquo; menu item in any Chromodo windows.</li>
	<li>Use the &ldquo;Reload Chromodo&rdquo; menu item in the Preloader's tray icon menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should you plan to work or/develop a theme or extension, the Preloader can easily get in the way be requiring the extra effort to terminate Chromodo.  To make sure that Chromodo always unloads when you close all Chromodo windows, you can deactivate the Preloader by using the &ldquo;Unload Chromodo&rdquo; menu item from tray icon menu.  You can make the Preloader resume its normal function by using the &ldquo;Reload Chromodo&rdquo; menu item in the tray icon menu.</p>
<h2>Using the Preloader Menu</h2>
<p>Right clicking on the Chromodo icon in the tray will present the following menu items:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Open My Homepage</strong> - Opens your current home page in a new browser window</li>
	<li><strong>Internet Options</strong> - Opens the preferences window to set Chromodo's options</li>
	<li><strong>Preloader Options</strong> - Opens the dialog where you set the Chromodo path and other options the pre-loader needs</li>
	<li><strong>Reload Chromodo</strong> - Unloads (if pre-loaded) and reloads Chromodo to clean Chromodo's memory cache, enable newly installed extensions, and use a newly applied theme.  This also reactivates the Preloader if it was deactivated.</li>
	<li><strong>Unload Chromodo</strong> - Unloads Chromodo and deactivates the Preloader to free memory for other applications, use &ldquo;Reload Chromodo&rdquo; to reactivate the Preloader and load Chromodo into memory.  This options is disabled when the Preloader is inactive.</li>
	<li><strong>About Chromodo Preloader</strong> - Displays the current version of the Chromodo Preloader installed</li>
	<li><strong>Unload Chromodo Preloade</strong>r - Unloads the Chromodo Preloader and any instances of Chromodo loaded by the Preloader</li>
</ul>
